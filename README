This directory contains code for the mergesort case study described in
chapter 12.

Files:

   mergesort.c    - OpenMP implementation of mergesort
   merge.c        - C support library
   Makefile       - makefile to build the mergesort application

To run the code:

1. You will need a OpenMP compliant C compiler to build the mergesort
   application.  We have tested the mergesort code using GNU C on 4.2.1
   on Mac OS X.

2. Type "make" to build the mergesort application.

3. Run the code by typing "./mergesort".  You can also explicitly specify the
   number threads, for example, "./mergesort 4"
